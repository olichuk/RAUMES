                More than 40 spacecraft have launched for Venus. One spacecraft – Japan's Akatsuki – is currently in orbit. NASA will launch two missions to Venus in the next decade, and ESA will launch one. NASA's Mariner 2 was the first spacecraft to visit any planet beyond Earth when it flew past Venus on Dec. 14, 1962. Data gathered in a 42-minute scan forever changed how we see Earth's closest neighbor. It revealed Venus as a runaway global hothouse. Understanding what went wrong with Venus' climate could help protect Earth.More than 40 spacecraft have launched for Venus. One spacecraft – Japan's Akatsuki – is currently in orbit.
